# About me
I am a 25-year-old student from Santa Maria, California, pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines. In 2023, I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, after which I worked for two years in the commercial space launch industry as a flight safety analyst.

Through my work experience, I discovered a passion for software engineering and decided to broaden my expertise with the goal of developing simulation and embedded systems software. I plan to apply the skills I am building toward careers in the transportation or robotics industries.

## Research
I am beginning research with the [NAPPLab](https://www.napplab.org) under Dr. Micah Corah at the the School of Mines. My planned focus is on optimization and motion planning algorithms for coordinating distributed multi-robot systems.

## Hobbies
I enjoy bouldering, skiing, playing music, and cooking.
