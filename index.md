# About me
I am a 25 year old student from Santa Maria, California pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the
Colorado School of Mines. In 2023, I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a B.S. in aerospace engineering, after which I worked in the commercial space launch industry as a flight safety analyst for two years. 

In my work experiences, I found a passion for software engineering, and wanted to extend my knowledge to someday develop simulation or embedded systems software of my own. I plan to apply the skills I am learning towards the transportation or robotics industries.

## Research
I have begun researching with [NAPPLab](https://www.napplab.org) under Dr. Micah Corah at the the School of Mines. I plan to focus on optimization and motion planning algorithms for coordinating teams of distributed robots.

## Hobbies
I like to rock climb (bouldering), ski, play music, and cook.
