# About me
I am a 25-year-old student from Santa Maria, California, pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines. In 2023, I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, after which I worked for two years in the commercial space launch industry as a flight safety analyst.

Through my work experience, I developed a passion for software engineering and decided to broaden my expertise with the goal of developing scalable systems for scientific applications.

## Research
I am currently a research assistant working with Dr. Daniel McKenzie in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics Department at Mines. My research focuses on developing deep learning models for rainfall-runoff modeling that combine LSTM and physics-based models to improve streamflow predictions.

## Hobbies
I enjoy bouldering, skiing, playing music, and cooking.
